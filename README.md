# Time based and sunlight based schedules for Philips hue
With this NodeJS script you can configure time based and sunlight based schedules for your hue lights. Just enter your username (read [the Philis hue API documentattion](http://developers.meethue.com/gettingstarted.html) to set up your username) and change the config JSON to your personal likings.

I hope the code is pretty self explanatory. :)
